### What I Learned
- This week, we worked on the dashboard visualization for our Smart AI-Based Waste Bin Management system. I learned how to present data in a clear and organized way, making it easier for users to understand the waste bin fill levels and AI predictions. We used real-time data from sensors and displayed it using charts and indicators to show trends and current status. I also learned the importance of selecting the right type of visualization for each data point to improve clarity and impact. 

### Blockers
- While building the dashboard, we encountered a few challenges. One issue was integrating live data streams into the dashboard in a smooth and consistent way. We also struggled at first with choosing the best chart types for different datasets, which sometimes made the dashboard feel cluttered or unclear.

### Reflection
I feel proud of the progress we’ve made and how we brought our technical work to life through visualization. Creating the dashboard helped me better understand how users interact with data and what makes a system intuitive.

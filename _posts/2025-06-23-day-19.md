### What I Learned
- how to set up and connect components on a breadboard using an ESP32 microcontroller. I practiced wiring sensors and resistors correctly to ensure proper data flow and communication between the microcontroller and other modules. I also learned how to use jumper wires to make connections between digital and analog pins. Working with the breadboard helped me understand power rails (positive and ground) and how to manage clean circuit layouts.

### Blockers
- was ensuring all the components were correctly powered and wired. At first, some of the sensor connections were loose, which caused unstable readings or no response. I also struggled a bit with identifying the correct GPIO pins on the ESP32 and matching them to the code.

### Reflection
I feel more confident working with physical hardware and understanding how microcontrollers interact with different components. It was a bit frustrating at first when things weren’t working, but once I figured out the wiring and saw everything come to life, it was really rewarding.

### What I Learned
-  I learned how to structure and write a proper research paper thanks to the session led by the Morgan Writing Research Lab. They explained the key components of academic writing, including forming a strong thesis, organizing content into sections like the introduction, methodology, and results, and properly citing sources. This guidance will help us present our project clearly and professionally. In addition to the writing session, we also worked with data to build predictive models for our project. We used three different machine learning algorithms—Support Vector Regression (SVR), Linear Regression, and Random Forest—to compare performance and understand which model best fits our dataset. 

### Blockers
- Understanidn the difference between all 3 algorithms 

### Reflection
I feel more confident about starting my research paper. Having a clear writing structure and being able to connect our data models directly to our research topic makes the process more meaningful.

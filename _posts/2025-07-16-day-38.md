### What I Learned
- This week, I worked on the hardware side of the smart waste bin system and contributed to creating the schematic drawing. I learned how to properly connect sensors like the ultrasonic and gas modules to the ESP32 and ensure stable power supply and data transmission. Building the schematic helped me understand the importance of precise wiring and component placement. We also started the deployment phase, which involved testing the system in real-time and preparing it for live use

### Blockers
- was troubleshooting sensor connections, especially making sure they gave accurate readings during testing. We also faced issues syncing the schematic with the actual breadboard layout, which caused a few delays. 

### Reflection
I feel more confident working with hardware and understanding the relationship between circuit design and system behavior. Starting the deployment phase made the project feel real and showed how much progress we’ve made

### What I Learned
- We are rounding up our final few tasks before we present on thursday. We worked on overleaf and made sure our code worked for AI and arduino. We tested our prototype and made sure all the components are in good condition. We finished our final powerpoint and added all neccesary slides. I worked on the literature review for the powerpoint and helped did test run for our prototype

### Blockers
- N/A

### Reflection
I feel very excited and sad that the internship is ending. I learnt alot and made very good connections

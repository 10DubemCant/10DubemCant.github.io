### What I Learned
- Today, we presented our AI Smart Waste Bin Monitoring project, which uses an ESP32 microcontroller, sensors, and cloud integration to track waste levels in real time. Through the presentation, I learned how to clearly explain the technical aspects of our system, including how machine learning models like regression are used to predict bin fill levels. Preparing for the presentation helped me understand our project’s workflow better and highlighted the importance of collaboration and communication. I also gained confidence in sharing complex ideas with others and saw firsthand how visuals and demonstrations can make our work more engaging and easier to understand

### Blockers
- Had a hard time to explain certain things without sounding like a run off sentence 

### Reflection
I feel good and confident about our presentation tomorrow.

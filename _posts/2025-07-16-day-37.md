### What I Learned
- Today, we worked on our AI Smart Waste Bin prototype and focused on testing the Arduino code. I was in charge of the hardware side and helped connect and organize the components. We also made sure each part—like the sensors and microcontroller—was working properly. This was important for confirming that our setup was correct and ready for more advanced testing. Some parts needed a bit of troubleshooting, but overall, the system started coming together well. I learned more about how the hardware and software work together in real time

### Blockers
- A few components needed troubleshooting, especially during the initial testing phase. Making sure everything communicated smoothly with the Arduino took some extra time and adjustments.

### Reflection
I feel more confident working with the hardware after today. Testing and verifying that our components work gave us a clearer picture of what’s functioning and what needs improvement.

### What I Learned
I learned how to take a unique idea — analyzing football games through atmosphere — and turn it into a full product concept. I developed a clear value proposition, defined key features like the Atmosphere Index (AIx), and identified how the product would serve coaches, broadcasters, scouts, and fans. I also learned how to tailor content for a professional pitch by creating a slide outline, compressing ideas into text boxes, and understanding what different stakeholders would need from the tool.


### Blockers
- One blocker I had was figuring out how to turn something abstract like “crowd energy” into measurable data.

### Reflection
I feel proud of how this idea evolved into something that sounds both creative and feasible. I also feel more confident in developing and pitching ideas — not just technically, but in a way that connects with real-world use.

### What I Learned
- Today I experimented with several regression models—Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and Gradient Boosting—to predict waste bin fill levels based on sensor data. I learned how important feature engineering is, especially when dealing with time-series or categorical data. I used StandardScaler for normalization and saw how scaling impacts performance for certain models like Linear Regression. I also explored cross-validation to get more reliable accuracy scores and avoid overfitting. Visualizing residuals and prediction errors helped me understand which models were making consistent mistakes. I discovered that ensemble methods like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting usually outperform basic models but are more sensitive to tuning.

### Blockers
- A major blocker was dealing with imbalanced data—most records showed the bin as not full, which confused some models. It was hard to compare models when their scores were very close, and I wasn’t sure how to interpret their real-world effectiveness.

### Reflection
I feel more confident in building, evaluating, and selecting regression models for our bin prediction system. It’s clear that no single model fits all cases, and success depends heavily on how I prepare and understand the data

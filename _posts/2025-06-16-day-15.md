### What I Learned
- I learned how to set up the ESP32 microcontroller and successfully run a basic blink test using the Arduino IDE. I found out that using the correct USB data cable is important to power and program the board. I also learned how to install board support for ESP32 by adding a specific URL to the Arduino preferences and using the Board Manager. Modifying the Blink sketch taught me how to control a specific GPIO pin, in this case GPIO 2, to make an LED blink. Overall, this helped me understand the basics of programming and communicating with microcontrollers.

### Blockers
My computer was having storage issues so I couldnt download what I need for the arduino IDE

### Reflection
I feel more confident working with microcontrollers after setting up the ESP32 and running the blink test. At first, I was a little unsure about installing the board support and choosing the right port, but following the steps made it easier to understand. It was really satisfying to see the LED blink and know that my code was working.

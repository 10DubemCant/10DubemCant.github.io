### What I Learned
- I added several new components to our system, including a gas sensor, ultrasonic sensor, GPS module, and RFID sensor. I learned how each sensor works and how to connect and test them individually to make sure they function correctly. We also worked on integrating our project with Firebase, which helped me understand how real-time data storage works in the cloud. On top of that, I started learning the basics of machine learning and how it can be used to analyze sensor data for smarter decision-making.

### Blockers
- Some of the sensors were tricky to calibrate at first, and getting stable readings was a challenge—especially with the gas and ultrasonic sensors. Connecting Firebase also took time due to some authentication and setup issues. 

### Reflection
I feel l proud of the progress we made today, especially seeing different components work together. It was exciting to explore new technologies like Firebase and machine learning.

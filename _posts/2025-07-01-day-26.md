### What I Learned
- Today we connected our ESP32 camera to the microcontroller and tested its functionality using Firebase. I learned how to send data from the camera to Firebase and view real-time updates, which showed me how cloud integration works with IoT devices. We also explored how to manage live image capture and verify if the setup was transmitting correctly. Additionally, we spent time organizing and practicing our group presentation to clearly explain the technical aspects of our project

### Blockers
- We had some issues syncing data to Firebase at first, mostly due to incorrect credentials and Wi-Fi configuration. It also took a few tries to get the camera feed to display properly.

### Reflection
I feel productive today. Seeing the Firebase connection work gave me more confidence in the system we’re building. I'm also feeling more prepared to present now that we’ve worked through the technical setup and practiced explaining it

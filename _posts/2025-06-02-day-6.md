what_i_learned: |
   We learned about where to place our citations and discovered the color of an airplane's black box. We also learned about our project and read multiple articles related to it. We learned about new AI used in the research already used and the effects of it in the enviroment 

blockers: |

   Having a hard time figuring out what our device name/logo should be

reflection: | 
   Today was good, I realized that you have to do a lot of research before even doing anything technical, which can be tedious but very important, maybe even more or just as important than the technical aspect.

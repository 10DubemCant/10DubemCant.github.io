what_i_learned: |
In this study session, we gained a clearer understanding of proper citation placement within academic writing, ensuring our references are accurately and effectively used. We also discovered interesting facts, such as the true color of an airplaneâ€™s black box, which is actually bright orange for visibility. Additionally, we deepened our knowledge of our project topic by exploring multiple research articles related to it. Through these readings, we learned about various AI technologies already being applied in the field and examined their environmental impact, which helped us better contextualize our own work within the broader landscape of ongoing innovation.

   Having a hard time figuring out what our device name/logo should be

reflection: | 
   Today was good, I realized that you have to do a lot of research before even doing anything technical, which can be tedious but very important, maybe even more or just as important than the technical aspect.

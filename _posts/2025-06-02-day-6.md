what_i_learned: 
   We learned about where to do our citations and learned what color an airplane's black box is. We also learnt about our project and read multiple articles related to our project. We learned about new AI used in the research already used and the effects of it in the enviroment 

blockers: 

   Having a hard time figuring out what our device name/logo should be

reflection: 
   Today was good, I realized that you have to do a lot of research before even doing anything technical, which can be tedious but very important, maybe even more or just as important than the technical aspect.

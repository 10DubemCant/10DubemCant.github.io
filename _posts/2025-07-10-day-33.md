### What I Learned
-  learned how to structure and write a proper research paper thanks to the session led by the Morgan Writing Research Lab. They walked us through the key components of a research paper, such as crafting a clear thesis, organizing ideas into logical sections like the introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion, and using evidence effectively to support our arguments. They also emphasized the importance of maintaining an academic tone, properly citing sources, and revising through peer feedback. This knowledge is especially useful as we begin writing papers for our project, and it gave me a better understanding of how to present our research clearly and professionally.

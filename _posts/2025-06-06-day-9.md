### What I Learned
  We used the slides we created for the CLEAR project—Cloud-Enabled Automation for Refuse—to present our film today. This project taught me how to clearly and captivatingly explain complicated technological concepts to an audience, including cloud integration, AI prediction models, and IoT-based monitoring. It improved my comprehension of how each component of our system functions to address actual waste management issues and helped me recognize the importance of storytelling in technical presentations. I also realized how crucial literature reviews are to establishing the foundation of our study in the body of existing research and how they influence the technical course we're following.

### Reflection
I feel presenting CLEAR gave me confidence in both my technical understanding and my ability to communicate that knowledge. It also reinforced the potential for technology to drive sustainable change. I’m excited to keep building on what we’ve started and move toward the next stages of development.

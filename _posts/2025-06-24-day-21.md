### What I Learned
-  I learned more about Artificial Intelligence and how different models work, especially in the context of making predictions and recognizing patterns. I got a better understanding of supervised learning, where a model is trained using labeled data to predict outcomes, like classifying emails as spam or not. It was interesting to see how algorithms learn from examples and improve over time. We also touched on unsupervised learning and how it's used to find hidden patterns without labels. I’m starting to see how AI powers real-world tools we use every day.

### Blockers
- Some of the terms and concepts were confusing at first, especially understanding how models learn from data. It was also challenging to grasp the difference between all the types of learning (supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement)

### Reflection
I feel excited to keep learning about AI because it has so many real-life uses. Even though it was a bit overwhelming at first, I feel more confident now. It’s motivating to know that with practice

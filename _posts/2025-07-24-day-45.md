### What I Learned
Today’s guest speaker from the University of Alabama gave an engaging overview of Human–Computer Interaction principles, emphasizing the importance of user-centered design and iterative testing. I gained a clearer understanding of how small usability tweaks––like adjusting button placement or simplifying workflow steps––can dramatically improve overall user satisfaction. The discussion on accessibility best practices reminded me to always consider diverse user needs, especially when developing sensor-driven dashboards for our smart waste bins. I also picked up several practical strategies for conducting low-cost, rapid prototyping sessions in our lab setting.

### Blockers
Encountered some lingering bugs in the routing algorithm after integrating the revised UI components.

Felt uncertain about how to apply the speaker’s advanced usability metrics in our current prototype.

Ran into scheduling conflicts when trying to gather lab partners for a quick user-testing round.

### Reflection
I feel energized by the new HCI techniques and motivated to incorporate them into our next code iteration. Although the blockers slowed us down a bit, the lab session reinforced the importance of collaborative testing and gave me confidence that refining the user interface will pay off in better system performance and user satisfaction

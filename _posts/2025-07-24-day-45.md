### What I Learned
- Today’s guest speaker from the University of Alabama gave an engaging overview of Human–Computer Interaction principles, emphasizing the importance of user-centered design and iterative testing. I gained a clearer understanding of how small usability tweaks––like adjusting button placement or simplifying workflow steps––can dramatically improve overall user satisfaction. The discussion on accessibility best practices reminded me to always consider diverse user needs, especially when developing sensor-driven dashboards for our smart waste bins. I also picked up several practical strategies for conducting low-cost, rapid prototyping sessions in our lab setting.

### Blockers
- Encountered some lingering bugs in the routing algorithm after integrating the revised UI components.

### Reflection
I feel feel energized by the new HCI techniques and motivated to incorporate them into our next code iteration.

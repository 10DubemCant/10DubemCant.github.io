### What I Learned
- I learned how Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) can be applied to real-world problems like smart waste management. I gained an understanding of how components like ultrasonic sensors, microcontrollers, and wireless communication work together to monitor bin levels remotely. I also learned about challenges in traditional systems, such as dead zones and inefficient manual processes, and how this WSN-based system improves reliability and efficiency. Finally, I learned how data visualization and threshold-based alerts can help users quickly assess system status and take action when needed.

### Blockers
Understanding the information and visualizing what my project will do

### Reflection
Reading the article helped me appreciate the power of technology in solving everyday problems like waste management. I realized how important it is to design systems that not only work well but are also energy-efficient and easy to monitor.

### What I Learned
- we worked on connecting and testing multiple components like the gas sensor, ultrasonic sensor, GPS module, and RFID sensor.On the machine learning side, I got a better understanding of how models can process sensor data to make smart decisions.We also made progress with Firebase, learning how to store and sync real-time data from our sensors to the cloud We also practiced and finalized our presentation for Thursday, which helped us organize our ideas and explain the project clearly.

### Blockers
- N/A

### Reflection
I feel more confident in both my technical and presentation skills after today. Getting the sensors to work and seeing real-time data in Firebase was really motivating. Practicing for Thursday’s presentation helped me think about how to clearly explain the project to others

### What I Learned
- We worked through a practical scenario that showed how data inputs — like when a trash bin gets full — can help predict future patterns and optimize responses. This helped me understand how ML isn’t just about writing code; it’s about solving real-world problems through patterns and logic. By applying this to our smart waste bin project, we can make the system more accurate over time, learning from collection history and usage trends. It showed me the value of using data to improve efficiency, reduce waste, and build smarter cities.

### Blockers
- Being anxious during the presentation 

### Reflection
I feel more confident in understanding how machine learning connects to real-world projects. At first, the concept seemed complex, but working through the exercise made it feel more approachable. I also feel proud of how we were able to present our project clearly in just 30 seconds — it showed me that I can explain technical ideas in a simple way

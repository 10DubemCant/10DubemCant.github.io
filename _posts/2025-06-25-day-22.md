### What I Learned
- I also started learning about classification in machine learning, which is a type of supervised learning. It’s used to group data into categories, like identifying if an email is spam or not, or recognizing handwritten numbers. I saw how models use features from the data to make predictions and how accuracy depends on good training. Seeing both hardware and AI in action gave me a better idea of how they can work together in smart systems.

### Blockers
- I had a hard time at first connecting the Arduino board and getting the code to upload properly. It took a few tries to troubleshoot the connections and understand how each pin worked. On the ML side, it was a bit confusing to understand the difference between binary and multi-class classification at first

### Reflection
I feel proud of getting the Arduino to work because it made everything feel more real and hands-on. Learning classification in ML also helped me see how AI can make decisions based on patterns

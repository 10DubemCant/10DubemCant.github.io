### What I Learned
- I discovered that distilling our smart‑bin system into an elevator pitch helped me clarify its core value proposition and ensured every feature I describe serves a clear purpose. Diving into the literature review honed my ability to pinpoint where ultrasonic‑sensor research falls short and sharpened my critical reading skills. Mapping those gaps directly to our multi‑sensor fusion, local buffering, and predictive routing innovations reinforced how each design choice addresses a real-world need. Working in Overleaf taught me the importance of crafting logical transitions that guide readers smoothly from background to problem statement

### Blockers
- Condensing dense technical studies into a few crisp gaps without losing critical detail.

Seamlessly bridging the high‑level pitch with the in‑depth literature analysis.

Balancing jargon so the research review is both academically rigorous and investor‑friendly.

Keeping consistent terminology and formatting across our Overleaf document.



### Reflection
I feel  more confident about tying our technical solutions to real research needs, though I want to tighten the narrative so each section builds naturally on the last.

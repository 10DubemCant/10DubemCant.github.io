### What I Learned
  Today, we went around Morgan and looked at all the buildings to see which majors are most likely to be found in each one. After that, we learnt what we should do for our weekly report for tomorrow and what we should have in our presentations. I continued to read my second article for the topic "Cloud-based data storage in environmental monitoring" and I gained an understanding of how to sync data from IoT devices to the cloud, manage access securely, and visualize data through dashboards.

### Reflection
I feel like the internship is going so well. I'm learning a lot about the project I'm working on and about myself. I think the project I am doing is very interesting and has potential to become a big thing

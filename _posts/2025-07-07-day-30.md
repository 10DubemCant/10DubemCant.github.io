### What I Learned
- I explored tools like pandas for handling data, numpy for calculations, and matplotlib for visualization. I also learned how to build and test models like Random Forest and Linear Regression to make both classification and prediction decisions. Creating synthetic data helped me understand how to simulate real-world situations. I saw how clustering can group similar trash bins and how anomaly detection can find unusual patterns.

### Blockers
- One blocker I faced was understanding how to generate realistic synthetic data that mimics actual trash bin behavior. I also had trouble tuning the machine learning models and figuring out which features were most important for prediction.

### Reflection
I feel more confident about how machine learning can be applied to real-world problems. It was exciting to see how data, sensors, and algorithms work together to make smart decisions.

### What I Learned
- I learned a lot from the video—it gave me a clear understanding of how Arduino works, including how to write and upload code, use the Arduino IDE, and connect basic components. Even without the hardware, the explanations and examples helped me grasp the overall process and possibilities of Arduino projects.


### Blockers
- One major blocker is that I don’t currently have the materials or components to follow along hands-on. This made it harder to fully apply what I was learning, especially when it came to wiring and testing circuits. I also found the setup with drivers like CH340 a bit confusing without being able to try it out directly.

### Reflection
I feel motivated and excited to get started with Arduino once I have the materials. The video made it all seem approachable, and I’m looking forward to applying what I’ve learned.

### What I Learned
- We completed a personality cohort activity to better understand how we learn and work in teams. I discovered that I am a VARK learner, which means I benefit from a mix of visual, auditory, reading/writing, and kinesthetic learning styles. This insight helped me understand how I can process information more effectively. We also began working on our prototype for the AI Smart Waste Bin, applying our knowledge to a real-world solution.

### Blockers
- One challenge we’re facing is figuring out how to integrate different components of the prototype efficiently.

### Reflection
I feel  more aware of how I learn and contribute to group projects, which is helping me communicate better with my team. The progress we’re making on the AI waste bin prototype is exciting.

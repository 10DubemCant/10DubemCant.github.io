reflection: |

   I liked todsys brain teaser when we had to use spag noodles to make the highest building to put the marshmellow on top. It really gave me the excuse to use creativity on how to use the tools given to us. I also liked how we were in a team and we had our own responsbilites to make sure thr group succeeds.

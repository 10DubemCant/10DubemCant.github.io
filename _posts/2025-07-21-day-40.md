### What I Learned
- This week, we worked on Overleaf to draft our research paper and learned how to properly cite sources using LaTeX and BibTeX. I gained experience formatting academic content, managing references, and collaborating efficiently on a shared document. I also prepared and delivered a PowerPoint presentation on my AI-powered smart waste bin project, which helped improve my technical communication and public speaking skills. Creating the slides taught me how to visually summarize complex systems like IoT, machine learning, and cloud integration in a clear and engaging way. 

### Blockers
- One major blocker was learning how to format citations correctly using LaTeX, especially when entries didn’t render as expected in the bibliography. Managing contributions from multiple teammates on Overleaf also required some coordination and version tracking. 

### Reflection
I feel l more confident in both research writing and presenting technical work. This week helped strengthen my academic and professional communication skills.

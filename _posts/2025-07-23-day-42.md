### What I Learned
I learned that during the code review I spotted inconsistent naming conventions and some functions that could be simplified, which will make the code easier to maintain. I also saw the value of adding clear comments around the data‑processing steps so anyone new to the project can follow the logic. From the literature review, I understood how existing smart‑bin systems use single sensors or camera‑based TinyML but often miss predictive analytics and can fail when connectivity drops. An important research gap is the lack of integrated route planning and resilience to network outages in prior work. I realized our project’s combination of ultrasonic and gas sensors with on‑device forecasting and local buffering addresses those shortcomings.

### Blockers
 Refactoring the code to use consistent naming conventions took longer than expected and held up testing new features.

Integrating the gas sensor with the existing data pipeline caused unexpected calibration issues that I still need to resolve.

### Reflection
I feel motivated to tackle these challenges head‑on and confident that ironing out these issues will make our smart bin system both reliable and efficient

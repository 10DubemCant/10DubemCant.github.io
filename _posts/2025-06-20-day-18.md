### What I Learned
- I learned how to train Linear Regression models to analyze datasets and identify patterns or relationships between variables. This helped me understand how machine learning can be used to make predictions based on data trends. I also gained hands-on experience with coding and evaluating models to measure their accuracy. In addition, I successfully set up the ESP32 microcontroller and passed the Blink Test, which confirmed that my board was properly connected and responsive. This gave me a better understanding of how software and hardware interact. 

### Blockers
- One blocker I faced was understanding how to properly structure the data for training the Linear Regression model, especially when dealing with multiple variables. I also had some difficulty interpreting the output and figuring out how to measure the model's performance effectively.

### Reflection
I feel proud of the progress I made this week, especially being able to work through the challenges I faced. At first, I was frustrated by the technical issues with the ESP32 and the learning curve of training a Linear Regression model

### What I Learned
Today, I deepened my understanding of how C/C++ can be used to program hardware like Arduino devices. I also learned how to connect this code to cloud-based platforms like Google Colab, which allows for collaborative testing and development. Even without access to physical components, I was able to follow along and understand how the code would function in real-world scenarios.

### Blockers
 N/A

### Reflection
I feel more confident in approaching embedded programming and understanding how hardware and software come together. It was encouraging to see how cloud tools can be used to simulate and test code, even when physical hardware isn’t available. Despite the limitations, I learned a lot and feel more prepared for future hands-on work.

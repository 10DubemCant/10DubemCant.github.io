### What I Learned
- Today we tested our ESP32 setup by taking it outside into the sunlight to see if the sensor readings would change. It helped us confirm that the light sensor was working correctly and responding to real-world environmental changes. It was cool seeing how the microcontroller and code reacted in real-time. We also learned about regression in machine learning, which is used to predict continuous values—like temperature, humidity, or light intensity. It’s different from classification because instead of categories, the model predicts numbers. 

### Blockers
- making sure the ESP32 had stable power while outside, and getting accurate readings under different lighting conditions. 

### Reflection
I feel  more confident working with hardware now, especially after seeing the ESP32 perform in a real environment. Learning about regression also gave me new ideas for how to use sensors and AI together. It was a fun and productive day.

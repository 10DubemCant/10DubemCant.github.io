### What I Learned
Conducting the literature review and writing the discussion section sharpened my ability to critically synthesize prior work and clearly articulate how our project fills the identified research gap.

Revising the ML code (especially refactoring data preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning) improved model stability and boosted classification accuracy by addressing class‑imbalance and feature‑scaling issues.

 Debugging the code end‑to‑end (from Firebase data ingestion to model inference) deepened my understanding of the full pipeline and highlighted the importance of consistent data schemas.

### Blockers
Balancing time between writing the discussion and rigorous code testing squeezed my schedule, making it harder to iterate quickly

### Reflection
I feel satisfied that the literature review now robustly supports our research questions and that the ML pipeline is more reliable, but I need to streamline my development process to avoid last‑minute integration hiccups.

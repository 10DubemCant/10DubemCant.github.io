### What I Learned
I learned how our Machine Language Code works in our IDE (google collab). We successfully tested our ESP32 setup using the classic Blink example to confirm our board is functioning properly. We then verified two-way communication through the Serial Monitor, ensuring we can both send commands and receive data from the microcontroller.

### Blockers
- It was hard at first to understand ML and how precise it can be. 

### Reflection
I feel proud of the progress made in creating a functional prototype. The system successfully demonstrates the core concept of automated trash detection, though further refinement would be needed for real-world applications.

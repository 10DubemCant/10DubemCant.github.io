### What I Learned
- We presented our powerpoint for tomorrow's presentation. I revised my part of the slide and the ML code. We also tested out our prototype and it worked 100% functionality.

### Blockers
- N/A

### Reflection
I feel happy and sad that the internship is coming to a close and is very grateful for Dr.Mack for giving me a chance to expand my skillset and meet connections

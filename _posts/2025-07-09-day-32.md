### What I Learned
-Today, I learned how to use Support Vector Regression (SVR) with scikit-learn. I built a pipeline that includes StandardScaler for feature scaling and SVR for modeling. I also explored GridSearchCV to tune the model’s parameters for better performance. A major focus was understanding how to prepare the input and output data using .iloc[:, 1:2].values and .values.ravel() so they fit the expected format for the model.

### Blockers
- I was initially confused about how pipelines work, especially how the scaling and model fitting steps are connected. It also took time to fully understand how slicing with .iloc and reshaping with .ravel() prepare the dataset correctly for training.

### Reflection
I feel more confident working with regression models and ML pipelines. Going through real code examples helped solidify my understanding

### What I Learned
- I learned how to use overleaf and I learned more about the Adruino program and did a review of our device we created on tinkercard. I also expanded my knowledge of the Arduino programming environment, becoming more comfortable with writing and uploading code. In addition, we reviewed the virtual device we created on Tinkercad, analyzing its functionality and identifying areas for improvement. This hands-on review helped reinforce the relationship between circuit design and code implementation. 

### Blockers
- N/A

### Reflection
I feel more confident in my ability to work with both hardware and documentation tools. Learning how to use Overleaf made me feel more organized and professional in how I present technical work. Exploring Arduino and reviewing our Tinkercad project gave me a sense of accomplishment, especially as I begin to see how everything connects
